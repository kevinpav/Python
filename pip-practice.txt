Run the following commands:

pip install Django
  Installs Django

pip list
  Lists installed packages & versions

pip install Django (We know you already ran this one. What information do you see returned in terminal after this command?)
  Says "Requirement already satisfied"

pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?)
  Freeze outputs installed packages/versions in requirements format (xxx==1.2)

First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file?
  Creates the "requirements.txt" file. Contents are listing of installed packages and versions.

pip uninstall Django
  Uninstalled Django

pip show Django
  Returns nothing.

pip search Flask. This one might take a moment to execute.
  Looks like it lists available packages for Flask
